    <h2>FUNCTIONAL TESTING:-</h2>
    <p> <ul>
      <li>
        <ol>


      In Functional Testing We check <em><a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/functional-testing"><b>correctness and completnes</b></a></em> of the internal Functionality of the Application In this testing we validate different types of coverages such as</p>
  <h3>1)Behavioural coverage</h3>

<h3>2)Input Domain coverage coverage</h3>
<h3>3)Error Handling coverage coverage</h3>
<h3>4)Calculation Based coverage coverage</h3>
<h3>5)Service Level coverage coverage</h3>
<h3>6)Back End coverage coverage</h3>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/selenium-tutorial">1)Behavioural coverage</a></h3>
<p>In this we Check Property & Behaviour of the object. During this testing, we are going to validate the Objects property, I mean to say that we are
going to check the Behaviour of Objects.</p>

<h3>2)Input Domain  coverage</h3>
<p>-It Check Type and Size of the input<br>
-Type means DataType of input <br>
-Size means if mobile number tab is there then size will be 10.<br>
-In this Coverage we maintain BVA (Boundary Value Analysis) & ECP (Equivalence Class
Partition)</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="">
<h3>3)Error Handling coverage  coverage</h3>
<p>-In this we check whether system generate error message or not.<br>
-If we entered invalid information in field then system should be generate error message.<br>
Example: Mobile Number Field: If we entered less and more than 10 digit in mobile number
field then system generated message</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="">
<h3>4)Service Level coverage</h3>
<p>-In this we check working of system as per functional flow diagram or not.<br>
-In this Coverage check sequentially of functional module.<br>
-Ex: If you are filling online examination form <br>
-Then, 1) Personal Information Detail 2) Contact Details 3) Academic Details 4)
Banking/Payment details 5) Submit <br>
-In above example once one stage completed then system should allow to next stage.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="">
<h3>5)Calculation Based  coverage</h3>
<p>-In this we check athematic operations. <br>
-Athematic operations: <b>Addition, subtraction, division, multiplication</b> <br>
Example: On Amezon.com If we added Vivo mobile to cart & it's price 20K then & again
added new Samsung Mobile & Samsung Air Conditioner price 18K and 30K respectively.
Then it will be added in to cart then total price is 68K (It is done by Addition) and if we
cancelled/removed Vivo Mobile from Cart then total is 48K (It is done by Subtraction)....So
here we check this operations.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade="">
<h3>6)Back End coverage coverage</h3>
<p>-The backend of any software is data base.
-IN back end coverage we check whether entered data stored successfully in data base or
not. <br>
-We also check whether data get fetch from data base. <br>
-By using <b>SQL Queries.</b> <br>
Example: -If we filled online examination form by adding all required information then
clicked on Submit button. <br>
-Then all data save in data base. Then we check we are able log in or not by using User
Name and Password. <br>
-We can also fetch specific person/candidate information from data base.</p>
